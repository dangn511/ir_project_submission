# information-retrieval-project

A repository for our 50.045 Information Retrieval 1D Project! We are creating a search engine in Python for users to search for jobs that match their resume.

## How to use

### Installing
1.  Clone this repository and navigate to it
2.  Set up and activate a **Python 3.7** virtual environment (not really necessary, but recommended)
3.  Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if you prefer `conda`, you can check out the dependencies in `./requirements.txt` and install them accordingly)

### Running
1.  Run `views.py` (located in `./resume-job-search/`)
2.  Go to `localhost:5000` on your browser
3.  To stop the application, supposedly you can use <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>break</kbd> but that did not work for me; in Spyder I had to restart the kernel
